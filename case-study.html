      <h2>Pizza Store Database Case Study</h2>
      <p>A 3NF-compliant database system with PHP/MySQL integration for order management.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="resume-section">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and developed a fully functional database system for a pizza store to efficiently manage orders and customer data. The core deliverable was a <strong>3NF-compliant relational database</strong> built with MySQL, paired with a PHP front-end for data entry and management through user-friendly forms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="resume-section">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Design a normalized database schema that minimizes data redundancy and ensures data integrity by achieving Third Normal Form (3NF).</li>
        <li>Create a front-end interface using PHP for managing pizzas, customers, orders, and order details.</li>
        <li>Implement robust data validation and relationship management without relying on auto-increment keys.</li>
        <li>Support essential pizza store operations: placing orders, updating menus, tracking customers, and reviewing order histories.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="resume-section">
      <h3>Database Design</h3>
      <div class="resume-item">
        <h4>Entities &amp; Relationships</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Stores customer details with a unique customer ID.</li>
          <li><strong>Pizzas:</strong> Contains pizza types, sizes, and prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Orders:</strong> Represents each order placed by a customer with an order ID, date/time, and status.</li>
          <li><strong>Order_Items:</strong> Line items detailing which pizzas and quantities are included in each order.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h4>Normalization</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Each table was designed to eliminate duplicate data and ensure atomicity of fields.</li>
          <li>The schema adheres strictly to 3NF by:
            <ul>
              <li>Ensuring no partial dependencies on composite keys.</li>
              <li>Eliminating transitive dependencies to maintain data integrity.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Primary keys were manually assigned, avoiding auto-increment, to satisfy project constraints.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="resume-section">
      <h3>Front-End Implementation</h3>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h4>Forms and PHP</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Created PHP forms for adding, updating, and deleting records across all tables.</li>
          <li>Included input validation to prevent invalid or incomplete data from entering the system.</li>
          <li>Used dropdowns and input fields for smooth selection of pizza types and customer IDs.</li>
          <li>Used prepared statements to enhance database security and prevent SQL injection.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h4>User Experience</h4>
        <p>
          The interface was kept simple and intuitive, with clear visual feedback for success or error states. The focus was on functionality, accessibility, and reducing friction in the ordering workflow.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="resume-section">
      <h3>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintaining 3NF without auto-increment:</strong> Manually managed keys by tracking max IDs and incrementing them programmatically.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Used both client-side (HTML5) and server-side (PHP) validation to maintain data integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Form usability:</strong> Designed for clarity and error-prevention through iterative user testing and refinement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="resume-section">
      <h3>Results &amp; Learnings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gained experience designing normalized databases that meet real-world standards for efficiency and integrity.</li>
        <li>Built a working CRUD interface integrated with MySQL and PHP logic.</li>
        <li>Deepened my understanding of security, validation, and relational data modeling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Pizza Store Database is now a scalable, maintainable system capable of supporting daily pizza ordering operations with minimal risk of data anomalies.

      <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add reporting features for sales trends and customer insights.</li>
        <li>Integrate user authentication for employee roles and permissions.</li>
        <li>Enhance interactivity with JavaScript for real-time form validation and dynamic price calculations.</li>
